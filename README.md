# Project 2 - *Advanced Wordle*

Submitted by: **Yasaman Emami**

**Advanced Wordle** is an engaging app that provides entertainment and keeps you occupied. In this upgraded edition of the game, you have the flexibility to customize the number of characters, attempts, and the theme. You can also challenge yourself further by activating an alien feature, which adds an extra layer of difficulty by generating a new word to guess with each playthrough. Additionally, there is a convenient reset button that allows you to restart the game while maintaining your chosen settings.

Time spent: **1.5** hours spent in total

- [:white_check_mark:] User can change the number of letters per row (the length of the goal word)
